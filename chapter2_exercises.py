# Exercises for chapter 2: Problems 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 in Think Python
# Nick Rogov

# Problem 2.1: Integers entered with a leading zero are interpreted as octal (base 8), 
# hence 02492 is interpreted an an invalid number, and 02132 as 1114 = 2*(8^3) + 1*(8^2) + 3*(8^1) + 2*(8^0)

# Problem 2.2: Initial code produced no output. Modifed code with 'print' outputs 5 and 6.

# Problem 2.3: 
# 1) 8, int
# 2) 8.5, float
# 3) 4.0, float
# 4) 11, int
# 5) '.....', str

# Problem 2.4:
# 1) 523.5987755982989
# 2) $945.45
# 3) 7:30:6 am
